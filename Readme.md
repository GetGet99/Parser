# Get‚Äôs Parser and Lexer (BETA)

A general-purpose **lexer** and **LR(1) parser** framework for C#, designed with **analyzers** to catch conflicts and bugs **as you type** ‚Äî no custom extensions required.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This project is currently in **BETA**. Bugs may exist. Please report issues via the Issues tab.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Real-time conflict detection**: Lexer ambiguities, shift/reduce, and reduce/reduce parser conflicts are reported as diagnostics ‚Äî no need to run your program to catch critical grammar errors.
* **Seamless IDE support**: Designed to work with any C# IDE that supports Roslyn analyzers and source generators ‚Äî such as Visual Studio. No extensions required.
* **Two authoring modes**:
  * **Attribute-based (recommended)**: Full IntelliSense + diagnostics support via source generators.
  * **Manual in-code**: Build lexers/parsers programmatically (no attributes or generators), useful for advanced scenarios or experimentation ‚Äî but **no analyzer support**.
* **Custom semantic actions**: Embed custom C# logic for token values and grammar rules.
* **Fully integrated into C# projects**: Define your entire grammar directly in C# ‚Äî no external DSLs or tooling needed.

## üß± Lexer

The lexer takes an input stream of characters and emits `IEnumerable<IToken>`, optionally carrying values via user-defined callbacks. It supports:

* **Lexer state machines** via `GoTo(state)` and `Reverse(characters)`
* **Custom token processing** using semantic actions

### ‚úÖ Usage Options

* **Recommended**: Use the source generator with C# attributes (`CustomLexerSourceGen.cs`) for IntelliSense and diagnostics.
* **Advanced/manual**: Build lexer rules directly in code (`CustomLexer.cs`). This provides flexibility but **does not support analyzers**.

## üìö LR(1) Parser

The parser processes context-free grammar definitions, resolving them using **LR(1)** parsing logic. It supports:

* **User-defined semantic actions** embedded in C#
* **Precedence declarations** for disambiguating operator-like rules
* **Real-time validation** when using the attribute-based approach

### ‚úÖ Usage Options

* **Recommended**: Use the source generator with annotated methods (`TestSourceGenMath.cs`) for full IDE support.
* **Advanced/manual**: Define grammar rules directly in code (`TestRegex.DFA.cs`, `TestManualRuleAttr.DFA.cs`). This mode skips analyzers.

## üîç Analyzers

Our analyzer tooling surfaces:

* **Lexer conflicts**: Detected when rules overlap or produce ambiguity
* **Parser conflicts**: Shift/reduce and reduce/reduce issues
* **Inline diagnostics**: All shown directly in your IDE (e.g., Visual Studio)

> üìå **Analyzer support is only available when using the attribute-based (source generator) mode.** Manual in-code grammar definitions won‚Äôt receive analyzer feedback.
